# polyPK: an R package for pharmacokinetic analysis of multi-component drugs using a metabolomics approach

Pharmacokinetics (PK) is a long-standing bottleneck for botanical drug and traditional
medicine research. By using an integrated phytochemical and metabolomics approach coupled
with multivariate statistical analysis, we propose a new strategy, Poly-PK, to simultaneously monitor
the performance of drug constituents and endogenous metabolites, taking into account both
the diversity of the drugâ€™s chemical composition and its complex effects on the mammalian metabolic
pathways. Poly-PK is independent of specific measurement platforms and has been successfully
applied in the PK studies of Puerh tea, a traditional Chinese medicine Huangqi decoction and
many other multi-component drugs. Here, we introduce an R package, polyPK, the first and only
automation of the data analysis pipeline of Poly-PK strategy. polyPK provides 10 functions for data
pre-processing, differential compound identification and grouping, traditional PK parameters calculation,
multivariate statistical analysis, correlations, cluster analyses and resulting visualization. It
may serve a wide range of users, including pharmacologists, biologists and doctors, in understanding
the metabolic fate of multi-component drugs.

polyPK package is freely available here and from the R archive CRAN (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=polyPK).
